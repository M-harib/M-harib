## Philosophy & Vision

### ✨ Building Technology That Matters  
> *“Technology should be accessible to everyone.”*  
I believe the best innovations aren’t just technically impressive—they **change lives** and break down barriers.

### 🔐 Security Isn’t Optional  
> *“Every line of code should protect user safety and privacy.”*  
I write code with security and privacy in mind from the ground up.

### 🌱 Curiosity Drives Progress  
> *“Learning never stops.”*  
I follow real-world problems, not just homework. Every project is a chance to grow.

### Current Focus & Future Goals
